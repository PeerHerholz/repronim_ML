### Pre-trained models & weights

This directory contains the `pre-trained models` & their `weights`, as well as the original `metrics` for comparison reasons.
The `pre-trained models`/`weights` can be `load`ed and applied to new `data` or used for e.g. `transfer learning`.

The following files can be found here:

- `random_forest.joblib`: the `pre-trained`/`fitted` `random forest` `machine learning pipeline`
- `ANN.h5`: the `pre-trained` `ANN` along with its `weights`
