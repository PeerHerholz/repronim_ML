### Machine learning analyses scripts

This directory contains the `python scripts` with the run `machine learning analyses`. They can be used to rerun the conducted `analyses` or be adapted to new `data`.

The following files can be found here:

- `ml_reproducibility.py`: the version of the `analyses` that runs on the `datalad` `dataset` with existing `data`
- `ml_reproducibility.py`: the version of the `analyses` that doesn't run on the `datalad` `dataset` and `downloads` the `data` at the beginning
